# raukr 2021

Agenda for Jenny Bryan's instruction at:

  * [RaukR: Advanced R for Bioinformatics Summer School](https://nbisweden.github.io/workshop-RaukR-2106/)
  * 2021 June 14 - 24, ~Visby, Sweden~ Online
  
I also taught [in 2019](https://github.com/jennybc/2019-06_raukr-github-iteration#readme), about iteration and using Git/GitHub with R.

## Iterating well with R (and the tidyverse)

This will only be a 1-hour session, so I have very specific priorities for our "live" time:

* Iterate the R way
* Row-wise work in a data frame (with dplyr and friends)
* General iteration (with the purrr package)

Resources for future self-study:

dplyr vignette on row-wise operations

* <https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/rowwise.html>

Material on iterating with purrr (note: written before `dplyr::rowwise()` got re-energized):

  * <https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/purrr-workshop>
  * <https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/>
  
RStudio webinar (also before `dplyr::rowwise()`'s resurrection):

  * [Row-oriented workflows in R with the tidyverse](https://github.com/jennybc/row-oriented-workflows#readme)
  
Charlotte Wickham's purrr materials:

* <https://github.com/cwickham/purrr-tutorial>

"Functionals" chapter of 2nd of Advanced R by Wickham
